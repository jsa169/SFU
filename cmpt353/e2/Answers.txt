Question 1In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? What is the type, and describe the values.The result is the prediction of the rating, using the intercept and slope of the regression line.The data type is float. It forecasts a rating given a timestamp.Question 2In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?The timestamp simply translates the dates into one number. Using that number+ratings to calculate the regression. This is the same as using date to calculate the regression. Therefore, the result is a perfect fit line of the date obatained from date+ratings.
