1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

The sqrt got closest

2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

We cannot conclude that there are same number of comments on weekdays compared to weekends, therefore they must be different.

3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

Fix 3 is better, since the date we obtained is not normal. Since the original and transformed performs a regular t-test, the data has to be normal, the fact that data is not normal, means any conclusion from them is not likely right. For the CLT, the foundamental question is not the same. This leaves fix 3 to be the best answer.

4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

Weekends.
