    1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why? Do you have any theory about why RGB/LAB/HSV worked better for different models?

    Nearest Neighbours gave the best results. It only looks at the the colours around a point, which most correctly assembles the colour. Bayesian on the other hand, looks at the probaility of colour on a 2 dimentional level. However, since there a many colours which make a possibility of many diferent possibilities. It is hard to use Bayesian to predict the correct colours. For Nearst Neighbour, we only consider neighbours. Opposite thing goes for decision tree where there is not enough dimensions to get a good prediction. LAB colour considers Lightness and a,b colour, in this case Bayesian should work better than RGB since, it has one less colour to work with. And for HSV, its add another dimension (Hue), which should presumebly work better with a Decision Tree. Nearest neighbour should give about the same results on all three colour space.

    2. Have a look at the cities in your validation data where the weather model makes the wrong prediction. Do you feel like the model is making reasonable mistakes? Can you think of any weather features that we could potentially add to make better predictions? 

    Yes, the predicted city are all very closeby to the actual city. This means that the predicted and actual cities are most likely in the same climate zone, or similar geographical region. Since two cities in the same region might have very similar climate data, it is very difficult to predict the exact city. However, we can include more factors, such as air humidity, wind speed, and Sunset/rise times. With more factors like this, we may produce a better prediction.
