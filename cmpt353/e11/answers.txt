1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

I cached all the results that will be used to join with another df later. Basically, if I need a dataframe again sometime later, then I cached it. If no cache is used, the system will recaculate a dataframe when I need it again. This will lead to longer run time.

2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?

With broadcase is about 12 second faster than without broadcast
